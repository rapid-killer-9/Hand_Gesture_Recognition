# Hand_Gesture_Recognition
In this project we Have Implemented Hand Gesture Recognition using the packages [opencv](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python/) and [mediapipe](https://pypi.org/project/mediapipe/)  
Used Hand Model Detection Module and made two hand gestures controller
   1. Volume Controller : 
  In this, we have have made proper and accurate hand gesture.
  The volume increases and lowers in accordance with adjustments made to the tips of the thumb and index fingers.
  It not only shows on the us on the running window, but we can have a look on change of volume level on the device. 
  The Python Core Audio Windows Library, or [Pycaw package](https://github.com/AndreMiras/pycaw), which we utilised, is compatible with Python 2 and Python 3.


   2. Virtual Keyboard Controller : 
  In this, we have made Virtual Keyboard interface which can be operated by colliding index and middle finger together. 
  After doing this, the required text is typed simultaneously.
  With this virtual keyboard, you may type anywhere, just like we type on a notepad.
  For the virtual keyboard to function in any program, we utilised the [pynput package](https://github.com/moses-palmer/pynput).
